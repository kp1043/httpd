This project is built with Maven, so:

'mvn package' will build you a jar in target/ that you can run with 'java -jar httpd-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'.  Files are served from
./htdocs, and if you don't have such a directory, the server will create it.

The server also exposes some services:

/sys/services/EchoService?echo=Hello+World
/sys/services/RickService
/sys/services/HeaderEchoService
